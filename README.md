> The old GitHub font, a Chrome extension.

## Introduction

Self-explanatory. I used to make fun of people who entered the future kicking and screaming, but here we are. A nice quick lesson at learning how to make a Chrome extension. It's not perfect. If you have improvements to the CSS, PRs welcome! ðŸ˜€

## Installation

Haven't submitted to the chrome webstore yet. Right now you'll have to clone and load the unpacked extension.
