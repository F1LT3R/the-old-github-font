> The old GitHub font, a Chrome extension.

## Introduction

Self-explanatory. I used to make fun of people who entered the future kicking and screaming, but here we are. A nice quick lesson at learning how to make a Chrome extension. It's not perfect. If you have improvements to the CSS, PRs welcome! ðŸ˜€

## Installation

With great hesitation, I've published it to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-old-github-font/gklibcblhkjlfhfelnbelngjciflknhp).
