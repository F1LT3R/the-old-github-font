> The old GitHub font, a Chrome extension.

## Introduction

Self-explanatory. I used to make fun of people who entered the future kicking and screaming and dragging their heels, but shoe's on the other foot now. A nice quick lesson at learning how to make a Chrome extension. I think it's pretty close now, but if you have improvements to the CSS, PRs welcome! ðŸ˜¬

## Installation

With great hesitation and deepest regret, I've published it to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-old-github-font/gklibcblhkjlfhfelnbelngjciflknhp).

## Changes

- `v1.0.3`: slightly tweaked `.markdown-body` rule.

## License
